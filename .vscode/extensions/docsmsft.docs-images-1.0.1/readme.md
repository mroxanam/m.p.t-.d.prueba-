## Configuration

To configure the Learn Images, you can adjust the max height and max width of images. These are used when applying compression, if an image is larger than these values -- the image is resized whilst maintaining the aspect ratio, prior to compression.

> **Note:** A max height or width value of `0`, is interpreted as do not enforce resize.
